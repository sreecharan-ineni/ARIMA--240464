Titanic Project Report
Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
To make the data easier to work with, we removed columns that didn’t help much — like Name, Ticket, and PassengerID.

Missing values in the Age column were filled using the median age.

For the Embarked column, missing values were filled using the most common port.

The Cabin column was dropped because too many values were missing.

We changed Sex and Embarked into numbers using Label Encoding, so the model could understand them.
Also, we normalized the Age and Fare columns to make the values more uniform and easier for the model to learn from.

 Observations from the Model
Women had a much higher chance of survival than men.

Younger people were slightly more likely to survive.

People who paid a higher fare were more likely to live.

Passengers who got on the ship from Cherbourg (C) had slightly better survival rates.

A small family group helped survival, but having too many family members lowered the chance of living.

 Limitations
We lost some information by removing the Cabin column, which could’ve been useful.

The Logistic Regression model is simple. It doesn't understand how different features might work together (like how age and number of family members might affect survival).

Ideas to Improve
Use a better model that can understand deeper patterns (like Random Forest or XGBoost).

Try getting more useful information from the Name column, like titles (Mr., Miss, etc.) which might tell us something about the person’s background or status.

Look for ways to include social class or economic status by engineering new features.
