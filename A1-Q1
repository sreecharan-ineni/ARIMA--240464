a)
A ∩ B = NULL
A ∩ C = NULL
B ∩ C = NULL
So A, B, C are pairwise mutually exclusive.
P(A ∩ B) = NULL
P(A ∩ C) = NULL
P(B ∩ C) = NULL

b)
A ∪ B ∪ C = Sample Space
⇒ A, B, C are mutually exhaustive
P(A) + P(B) + P(C) = 1

c)
A Interection D ⇒ P(A | D) = P(A)
Also, P(A ∩ D) = P(A) × P(D)
⇒ Conditional probability remains unchanged if events are independent.
P(D | A) = P(D)
