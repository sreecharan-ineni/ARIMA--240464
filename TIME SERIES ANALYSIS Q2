Identify Any Visible Trend or Seasonality
The sales data shows a general upward trend—it starts at 20 and ends at 31.
No clear seasonality is visible since we only have 10 data points (less than a year’s cycle).

Plot Explanation
The blue line shows the original monthly sales.
The orange line (3-point moving average) smooths out fluctuations and highlights the overall increasing trend more clearly.

Observation: How Moving Average Helps
The 3-point moving average removes short-term ups and downs, giving a cleaner view of the long-term direction.
In this case, it confirms that sales are steadily increasing over time.
Even though we can't see any seasonal cycles, the smoothing helps us focus on the trend without being distracted by small jumps.
